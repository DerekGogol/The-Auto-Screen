The Auto Screen Turn On & Off source code README
------------------------------------------------

This is part of the source code from my app, The Auto Screen Turn On & Off, which turns device's screen on
and off automatically as the user either picks it up or puts it back on a flat (horizontal) surface such as
a table or desk.  I was only able to test it on two phones and two tablets, however, according to the
received user feedback, the app works well on most Android phones and tablets.

Below I listed file names and description of functionality I implemented in them.

DisplayDialogPage.java:

    Displays "Touch to keep Screen ON" button when the device is placed in horizontal position.  It will
    allow user to keep the screen on by touching the button, otherwise the screen will be turned off.
    Interestingly, this dialog establishes connection with SensorServiceOff, and if the button is touched
    by user, DialogWasTouched() method inside SensorServiceOff is called, canceling pending screen off
    event.

ScreenReceiver.java:

    This is Broadcast Receiver that intercepts ACTION_SCREEN_ON and ACTION_SCREEN_OFF events and handles
    them accordingly.  Depending on which of the two events is received, it will stop one service and
    start another.  I divided the logic into two services which run interchangeably.  One service runs
    when the screen is on and watches for certain conditions to turn the screen off.  The second service
    runs when the screen is off and watches for conditions to turn the screen on.  When the conditions
    are met, these services will turn the screen on or off.

SensorServiceOff.java:

    This is one of the two services mentioned above. It runs when the screen is on and watches for conditions
    that occur when the screen should be turned off. Namely, when the accelerometer sensor data indicates
    that the device has been placed in horizontal position, or proximity sensor indicates that the device
    is inside a pocket or handbag, this service will turn device's screen off.

StartAutoScreenAtBootReceiver.java:

    This is Broadcast Receiver that intercepts BOOT_COMPLETED event and starts service, if user preferences
    indicate that it should be started when the device is rebooted.

TheAutoScreen.java:

    This Activity will set the checkboxes accordingly to saved user preferences.  It also watches for user
    input, and sets user preferences.  If user touches "Start Service" or "Stop Service" buttons, this
    Activity will either try to start or stop the service.
